A smoother experience for managing plugins and themes.

## Description

Shiny Updates is a WordPress Core Feature Plugin.

It replaces *The Bleak Screen of Sadness™* (example) with a simpler and more straight forward experience when installing, updating, and deleting plugins and themes.
Progress updates for these actions don't add a benefit, they are disruptive and confusing. Shiny Updates deals with these details behind the scenes, leaving users with clear actions and results.

Development for this plugin takes place at GitHub.
To report bugs or feature requests, please use [Github issues](https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues).

### Testing
We need help testing the user flows! Please [install the Shiny Updates plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shiny-updates/), run the tests below, and share your feedback in the [#feature-shinyupdates](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/feature-shinyupdates) channel in Slack or [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues).
