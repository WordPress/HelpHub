* User changes the role, password or other profile settings of another user
* User on a WordPress multisite network is added or removed from a site 
* User uploads or deletes a file, changes a password or email address
* User installs, activates, deactivates, upgrades or uninstalls a plugin
* User creates a new post, page, category or a custom post type

* User creates, modifies or deletes a custom field from a post, page or custom post type
* User adds, moves, modifies or deletes a widget
* User installs or activates a new WordPress theme
* User changes WordPress settings such as permalinks or administrator notification email
