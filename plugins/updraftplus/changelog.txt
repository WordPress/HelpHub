This file contains changelog entries that are not contained in the main readme.txt file (that file contains the newest entries).

= 1.12.5 - 08/Apr/2016 =

* TWEAK: (Paid versions) - tweak the updater class so that it sends the information that updraftplus.com needs in order to correctly advise about language pack update availability.

= 1.12.4 - 07/Apr/2016 =

* FEATURE: Faster uploads to Dropbox, via adapting to network conditions: https://updraftplus.com/faster-dropbox-uploads/
* FEATURE: (Paid versions) Plugin now no longer bundles all translations - instead, WP's mechanism for downloading single translations, as/when needed, is used (reduces on-disk size by 12MB=36%)).
* FIX: Deal with some database encryption phrases with special characters that were incorrectly processed
* FIX: Deal with an error in the advanced retention rules processing code, that could lead to keeping the wrong backup set

= 1.12.2 - 30/Mar/2016 =

* TWEAK: When testing Amazon S3 bucket accessibility, slightly improve one of the corner-case checks
* TWEAK: When creating an encryption key for direct Migration, or UpdraftCentral, allow the user to choose their key size (this helps with PHP installs lacking both OpenSSL and GMP, in which case key creation can be really slow)
* TWEAK: Detect another case and deal with an HTTP 413 response when sending chunked data on a direct site-to-site migration

= 1.11.27 - 17/Feb/2016 =

* TWEAK: Prevent HTTP 500 download errors on some very large file/hosting setups
* TWEAK: A tiny number of users had a badly laid-out settings screen until they refreshed their browser cache. This release prevents that.

* TWEAK: Various bits of internal re-factoring to support future improvements

= 1.11.23 - 26/Jan/2016 =

* FIX: When migrating a sub-folder based multisite into a non-root install with different relative path to the source multisite (I can't think of any good reasons to do this), the search/replace could leave sub-sites unreachable without manual correction
* FIX: Logic errors in the advanced backup retention options could lead to the oldest backups being deleted prematurely, and some backups not being deleted when they were overdue for deletion

* TWEAK: Internal CSS re-organisation to make future layout changes easier
* TWEAK: The "stop" link in the backup progress indicator now halts the backup asap, instead of at the next scheduled resumption
* TWEAK: Clarify the course of action needed if you attempt a Dropbox backup without Curl
* TWEAK: Add support for the new Asia Pacific (Seoul) region to Amazon S3
* TWEAK: Make the automatic backup option box appear on the updates page for users who can update plugins or themes (not just core - previously it was assumed that these would always go together in the real world, but some managed hosts are now removing the core update capability from the default admin user, whilst leaving the others)
* TWEAK: Change default zip split size to 400Mb on new installs
* TWEAK: Clean up use of composer, to conform to proper usage standards, and update to current version (to avoid causing a problem for plugins using PSR-4 autoloaders)
* TWEAK: Provide direct links to cart when choosing UpdraftPlus Vault storage
* TWEAK: Add debug.log to the default exclusions in wp-content (when people leave debug logging on and forget, it can get huge)

* TWEAK: Update to phpseclib 1.0.1
* TWEAK: Prevent a PHP notice when using SCP

* FIX: Prevent PHP fatal error on admin area in some restore scenarios

= 1.11.20 - 21/Dec/2015 =

* FEATURE: WordPress multisite backup administrators can now selectively restore data from a chosen site, instead of restoring the entire WordPress install - https://updraftplus.com/selectively-restoring-on-wordpress-multisite/ (requires WP 3.5+, UpdraftPlus Premium)
* FEATURE: Import a WordPress single-site backup into WordPress multisite, as a new site (requires WP 3.5+, UpdraftPlus Premium) - https://updraftplus.com/information-on-importing-a-single-site-wordpress-backup-into-a-wordpress-network-i-e-multisite/
* FIX: Properly encode folder paths with Copy.Com, allowing some previously prevented folder names to work

* FIX: When using multiple remote storage providers, a race condition could lead to some old backups not being deleted on the storage not uploaded to last
* FIX: Views are now placed after tables in the database backup
* FIX: In-page uploader widget was not working on sub-domain based multisites in some dashboard access scenarios
* FIX: Package Net/URL2 (PEAR), so that servers without it already can use Microsoft Azure blob storage
* TWEAK: Upgrade Microsoft OneDrive API usage to latest version
* TWEAK: Automatic backups are now hooked into the themes page in the network admin on WP multisite installs
* TWEAK: Dashboard messages were not being clearly shown when trying to use UpdraftPlus Vault without PHP Curl available
* TWEAK: Protect against other plugins loading incompatible Google SDKs when Google Cloud is being used
* TWEAK: When trying to use S3, DreamObjects or UpdraftPlus Vault without PHP Curl available, make the cause of the problem more obvious
* TWEAK: When sending data to remote site, keep re-trying on receipt of an HTTP 413 (request entity too large) down to 64Kb (instead of previous 128Kb) - a webserver was seen in the wild configured at this level
* TWEAK: Detect the WordPress scheduler invoking a scheduled backup multiple times, in some cases where the existing semaphore lock wasn't helping (because the backup already finished, or the WP scheduler invoked multiple instances of the same event minutes apart - apparently possible when very heavily overloaded)
* TWEAK: Detect an inconsistent semaphore locking state, and fix it (apparently only possible upon unexpected server crash)
* TWEAK: Provide a button to cancel (not just continue) an interrupted restore
* TWEAK: Work around buggy Ubuntu PHP versions - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/php5/+bug/1315888

* FEATURE: Full support for Microsoft Azure blob storage (UpdraftPlus Premium)
* FEATURE: Allow all files beginning with a defined prefix to be excluded from the backup by inputting (for example) prefix:someprefix_,prefix:someotherprefix- in your exclusion settings - see: https://updraftplus.com/faqs/how-can-i-exclude-particular-filesdirectories-from-the-backup/
* FEATURE: UpdraftPlus Premium can now restore backups created by "Dropbox Backup" by WPAdm

* FIX: With multi-archive backup sets, files in the top level of a backup of WP core or 'others' were not restored by an in-dashboard restore if they over-wrote an existing non-identical file if they were not in the first archive

= 1.11.17 - 13/Nov/2015 =

* FIX: Resolve a conflict with "Simple Calendar" (formerly "Google Calendar Events") since their re-written 3.0 release, when using Google Drive storage

= 1.11.15 - 28/Oct/2015 =

* FEATURE: Google Cloud Storage support (UpdraftPlus Premium)
* FIX: Automatic backups of WordPress core prior to WP core upgrade in recent versions were including non-WP core files
* FIX: OwnCloud 8.1's WebDAV server responds differently, breaking UD's communications: restore the ability to back up to OwnCloud WebDAV
* TWEAK: Allow use of the Meta key for selecting multiple backup sets (as well as Control)
* TWEAK: When sending backup data directly site-to-site (when migrating), handle the (very rare) case where a remote server complains of the chunk size after accepting previous chunks of the same size
* TWEAK: Add message to final log line when sending backup set directly to a remote site, reminding the user of what to do next.
* TWEAK: Tweak zip-splitting algorithm, to prevent delayed split on resumption when final file in the last-created zip is gigantic
* TWEAK: By default, exclude directories that appear to be the UpdraftPlus internal directory of a site stored in a sub-directory when backing up WordPress core

= 1.11.12 - 29/Sep/2015 =

* FEATURE: More sophisticated rules for retention/deletion (UpdraftPlus Premium) - https://updraftplus.com/more-sophisticated-backup-retention/
* FEATURE: Delete multiple backups at once - https://updraftplus.com/deleting-multiple-backups/
* FEATURE: When choosing a monthly backup, you can now choose the starting date (e.g. choose 17th, not just choose the next week-day, e.g. next Monday)
* FEATURE: You can exclude files with any particular extension by using the constant UPDRAFTPLUS_EXCLUDE_EXTENSIONS (comma-separate different extensions), or by inputting (for example) ext:.zip,ext:.mp4 in your exclusion settings.
* FEATURE: Tested and supported on the forthcoming PHP 7.0
* FIX: SFTP uploads could hang after finishing, if more than one attempt was needed to upload the file
* FIX: Stop causing JavaScript errors on WordPress 3.2 on the plugins page
* TWEAK: UI improvement when choosing multiple storage options - https://updraftplus.com/a-prettier-way-to-choose-remote-storage-options/
* TWEAK: The storage selection drop-down (free version) now has icons to make it easier on the eye
* TWEAK: Use UpdraftPlus Vault logo
* TWEAK: Replace target="_new" with target="_blank" when opening new browser ports, to be more standards-compliant
* TWEAK: Tweak the auto-split algorithm again to catch another case where it would have been better to split in a low-resource situation
* TWEAK: When checking the backup integrity, allow for a multisite to not have a root options table; check sitemeta instead (unlikely, but theoretically possible)
* TWEAK: Raise default Google Drive network timeout from 15 seconds - it's too possible to hit this on a slow uplink (e.g. congested ADSL)
* TWEAK: Upgrade the bundled Google SDK to the most recent release (1.1.4)
* TWEAK: Add previously-untranslated string
* TWEAK: Suppress a PHP notice relating to a constant that needed quoting
* TWEAK: Turn off reporting of PHP deprecation conditions if using phpseclib on PHP 7 (can break communications - phpseclib uses PHP4-style constructors)
* TRANSLATIONS: Various updated translations

= 1.11.9 - 04/Sep/2015 =

* FIX: Dropbox introduced an un-documented, un-announced change to their server, which caused new site authentications in UpdraftPlus to no longer work. Now fixed with this release.
* FIX: If backing up multiple extra directories under "more files", if large directories required a resumption, then inclusion of the files multiple times in the backup was possible.
* TWEAK: Tweak the auto-split algorithm to not avoid firing in a particular case (that relies on a sequence of unlikely I/O events, seen on GoDaddy) if there's no resumption scheduled
* TWEAK: Add mysql.sql to the (changeable) default configuration for excludes from wp-content - on WP Engine this is an unreadable file that they create that thus produces a backup warning
* TWEAK: Add a dashboard warning (+ link to documentation) if UD appears to be incompletely installed
* TWEAK: Add UPDRAFTPLUS_WEBDAV_NEVER_CHUNK constant for WebDAV servers that return the wrong error code when chunking fails
* TWEAK: Introduce a UPDRAFTPLUS_REMOTESEND_DEFAULT_CHUNK_BYTES constant allowing the over-riding of the remote-send (Migrator) starting chunk size in wp-config.php (expert users)

* TWEAK: If gzopen() is disabled, then test binzip without trying to use PclZip to verify the results
* TWEAK: Add work-around for PHP bug https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=62852

= 1.11.6 - 22/Aug/2015 =

* FIX: SFTP was not working in 1.11.4 for some servers (related to phpseclib library update and sources of random data)
* FIX: 1.11.5 release had wrong version number in header for paying users; corrected with fresh release

= 1.11.4 - 19/Aug/2015 =

* FIX: Perform previously missing tweak on the database after restoring a multisite backup to an install with a different table prefix, which inhibited the ability to create new users on the main site in a network.
* TWEAK: Remove an inefficiency when examining files to prune from Google Drive, reducing the amount of time needed.
* TWEAK: Show a warning if UpdraftPlus's directory in wp-content/plugins has been manually renamed to include a space, which WordPress does not support
* TWEAK: Skip search/replacing of the 'guid' column in the posts table when migrating (improves performance - and prevents possible re-appearances of blog articles in peoples' feed readers if double-migrating)
* TWEAK: Upgraded the bundled phpseclib Math, Net and File libraries to current versions (1.0 branch)
* TWEAK: Prevent PHP notice in log file when deleting FTP backup from dashboard
* TRANSLATIONS: Updated translations, including Greek

* FIX: Fix access to UpdraftPlus Vault for some PHP 5.2 users

= 1.11.2 - 11/Aug/2015 =

* TWEAK: Handle the results when someone with no UpdraftPlus Vault quota attempts to connect more gracefully

= 1.11.1 - 10/Aug/2015 =

* FEATURE: UpdraftPlus Vault storage - simple to set up storage from your trusted provider: https://updraftplus.com/landing/vault - with 1Gb of free storage for UpdraftPlus Premium customers ( https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftplus-premium/ ) - and more storage available for anyone to purchase. All other storage options (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) remain available, of course!
* FEATURE: S3 enhanced wizard now allows the user to optionally deny the new Amazon Web Services IAM user download and/or delete permissions, for an even more secure setup (at the cost of some convenience - you will need to download/restore/delete S3 backups outside of UpdraftPlus).
* FEATURE: Amazon S3 in UpdraftPlus Premium now supports optional server-side encryption
* FEATURE: An "UpdraftPlus" menu now appears on the WP admin bar, allowing quick access.
* COMPATIBILITY: Tested and compatible with WordPress 4.3
* SPEED: For users' whose backups are created with a zip binary (the default engine, where available), CPU usage + zip creation times have been significantly reduced
* SPEED: For users cloning a website with a large number of users and a changed table prefix, a long and slow series of SQL operations has been replaced with a single fast one
* FIX: The chunk-uploading algorithm for Copy.Com could unnecessarily upload the same chunks multiple times. We have not had any reports, but we believe it's also theoretically possible that a Copy.Com upload could have been corrupted by the same issue, so recommend updating for all Copy.Com users.
* FIX: Fix issue with site cloning whereby on sites with very large numbers of entries in the postmeta table that needed search/replacing, some could be omitted (in the case seen, the table had >600,000 entries)
* FIX: Saving the settings immediately after authenticating with Copy.Com resulted in being redirected to WP's page for all settings.
* FIX: If PHP was killed by the webserver during the process of pruning old backups, then this would not be retried until the next backup, thus potentially leaving more backups than desired around in remote storage in the meanwhile.
* FIX: Log files sometimes failed to mention the MySQL version
* TRANSLATIONS: Various updated translations - thanks to our translators
* TWEAK: When choosing multiple remote storage options (Premium), these are now stacked via tabs, instead of vertically as before
* TWEAK: More help for enormous sites on badly resourced web hosting: part of the enumeration of uploads needing backing up is now cached, allowing more to be time when time limits are short
* TWEAK: Secret credentials (e.g. S3 secret key) in the admin area are now starred (as explained in our long-standing FAQ, this does nothing to protect against malicious WordPress co-admins on your site - https://updraftplus.com/faqs/in-the-administration-section-it-shows-my-amazon-ftp-etc-passwords-without-using-stars-is-this-safe/ - but at least we won't get asked about it so many times!).
* TWEAK: Provide more direct help to the user if they are hosting with Strato and get the 'File Size Limit Exceeded' zip message
* TWEAK: When migrating data directly to a remote site, if the remote site returns a 413 HTTP code ("Request Entity Too Large"), re-try using a smaller chunk size
* TWEAK: Log when about to begin encryption of a database file (allowing the progress to be monitored more easily if there's a problem)
* TWEAK: Detect a further case of an incompatible database (that is from a remote source and uses MySQL features not present on the destination server) and warn before attempting to import.
* TWEAK: Make the error message shown if trying to restore an incompatible database (that is from a remote source and uses MySQL features not present on the destination server) clearer.
* TWEAK: If the user uses "Backup Now" before saving their settings, warn them that the unsaved settings changes won't apply to this backup
* TWEAK: Only warn about very large files found once for each file (rather than once per resumption)
* TWEAK: Add the UPDRAFTPLUS_GOOGLEDRIVE_DISABLEGZIP constant - define it as true to work-around broken HTTP setups (possibly broken outgoing proxy?) when accessing Google Drive
* TWEAK: When claiming an add-on (paid versions), the user's updraftplus.com password will automatically be forgotten once it is no longer needed
* TWEAK: Handle the case of the user typing in an invalid number of backups to retain more elegantly
* TWEAK: No longer require the php-mcrypt module for Dropbox 
* TWEAK: Also retry a smaller chunk size if it looks like mod_security unhelpfully replaced a 413 HTTP code with a 200 success message despite the operation actually failing for this reason, or if it looks like sending is just timing out before the PHP timeout (so that we don't get notified).
* TWEAK: Added new CA root certificates to store (http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem)
* TWEAK: If the Migrator's direct-send component drops its chunk size, then store this information so that it doesn't have to go through the cycle of finding the best chunk size the next time.
* TWEAK: Added UPDRAFTPLUS_IPV4_ONLY constant to prevent use of IPv6 (currently implemented by Google Drive only)
* TWEAK: Deal with a case where the web host appears to be losing disk I/O near kill time, despite later database writes going through (so, the order of operations was insufficient to guarantee what had been completed). This issue was only cosmetic - backup sets were intact (hence "tweak", not "fix")
* TWEAK: Increase HTTP timeout for remote site-to-site operations
* TWEAK: Don't cause the 'debug' tab to abort rendering if the web host has disabled the gzopen() function (which is an odd/pointless thing to do)
* TWEAK: Resolve PHP 'strict standards' coding internal notice in Google Drive module

= 1.10.3 - 2015-06-09 =

* FEATURE: Migration component can now send backup data directly from one WP site to another - https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftplus-premium/
* FEATURE: Support active mode FTP servers (extremely rare)
* FIX: The error message when choosing no components to restore was empty
* FIX: Restore ability to run on WordPress 3.5 (actually fixed in downloads of 1.10.1 after 2015-05-13)
* FIX: Some automatic pre-upgrade backups were not marked internally as such, leading UD to delete the oldest scheduled backup prematurely backups prematurely
* TWEAK: Reduce HTTP round-trips when checking presence + downloading backup archives in a restore/migrate operation
* TWEAK: Alert the user earlier if they're trying to use a database with a character set not supported by MySQL
* TWEAK: Use separate internal jobs for separate downloads, and thus avoid race conditions when updating job data (symptom: download widgets that don't show current information)
* TWEAK: Add constant UPDRAFTPLUS_SFTP_TIMEOUT allowing users to over-ride (via wp-config.php) the default SFTP timeout (default now: 15 seconds).
* TWEAK: Make Copy.Com filter out non-backups from remote file listings at an earlier stage
* TWEAK: Log more information when a curl error occurs when getting a OneDrive access token
* TWEAK: Code re-arrangement in OneDrive library to deal with sites using the obsolete PHP safe_mode
* TWEAK: Clearer message for users whose access to paid plugin updates has expired (paid versions)
* TWEAK: Improve detection of started pre-upgrade automatic backups in case of webserver misbehaviour
* TWEAK: Fix untranslated message when confirming the wiping of settings
* TWEAK: Replace more non-SSL links to updraftplus.com with SSL links
* TWEAK: Use a POST instead of a GET during one of the restore sub-stages (avoids a false positive on some mod_security setups)
* TWEAK: Improve backup-file-naming routine to reduce the times when no ASCII name can be found (ASCII is preferred as not all cloud storage methods will accept arbitrary characters in filenames)
* TWEAK: Don't keep a log file (unless debug mode is on) for scheduled tasks that result in the result that nothing needs backing up
* TWEAK: Remove cache files from Cherry Framework child themes upon migration (framework misbehaves if cache files are present after URL change)

= 1.10.1 - 2015-05-12 =

* FEATURE: Microsoft OneDrive support (Premium version) - full support (including chunked/resumable uploading and downloading)
* FEATURE: Allow prevention of backup of unwanted tables, via a filter; see: https://updraftplus.com/faqs/how-can-i-exclude-a-specific-table-from-the-backup/
* FIX: Restore window would not open if date contained a single quote character in it (which was possible only in some languages)
* FIX: Restore the ability of PHP installations (< 1%) without curl to use Google Drive (broke when Google introduced a new SSL certificate at their end which PHP couldn't handle properly without extra help).
* TWEAK: Add woocommerce_order_items and relevanssi_log to the list of potentially huge tables that won't need search/replacing
* TWEAK: Add link to admin email setting and fix broken link to reporting add-on in free version
* TWEAK: Provide more direct help for paid users getting blocked by the security shield when connecting for updates access
* TWEAK: Small tweak in zip-splitting algorithm if it looks likely that there are insufficient resources with no further resumptions yet scheduled
* TWEAK: "Migrate" dialogue, when the Migrator is installed, now contains a widget to use directly (instead of just directing to other route)
* TWEAK: Ask user to confirm if they navigate away from the settings page with unsaved changes
* TWEAK: Replace some non-SSL links to updraftplus.com with SSL links, and replace all non-SSL readme links
* TWEAK: Add UPDRAFTPLUS_DBSCAN_TIMEOUT constant to control how much time is allowed for scanning database, and make the default vary instead of constant (will help users with absolutely enormous databases).
* TWEAK: Provide clearer guidance to users with a wrong updraftplus.com password entered for updates
* TWEAK: When cloning a site with Jetpack, automatically clear Jetpack invalid connection status
* TWEAK: Prevent some old admin notices from being repeated when saving settings

* FIX: Fix failure to access some files (e.g. for downloading or deleting) in Google Drive folders that contained >100 UpdraftPlus backup archives (thanks to IanUK for his help)
* TWEAK: Amazon S3 reduced redundancy storage (a feature of UpdraftPlus Premium) now requires use of PHP 5.3.3 or later.
* TWEAK: Various fixes to bring automatic backups code up to date with WP 4.2 release candidate 1 (there were some changes since beta 3, which worked since UD 1.9.62)
* TWEAK: Update to version 2.0 of plugin updater class (https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker) - necessary on WP 4.2 to prevent shiny updates after the first failing when 3rd party plugins exist, and to suppress a PHP notice on the plugins page.
* TWEAK: Add wp_rp_tags to the list of potentially huge tables that won't need search/replacing
* TRANSLATION: New Slovenian translation, courtesy of Clav Icula

= 1.9.63 - 2015-04-03 =

= 1.9.62 - 2015-04-01 =

* FEATURE: Automatic backups now integrate with the forthcoming WP 4.2's "shiny plugin updates"
* COMPATIBILITY: Tested and marked compatible with the forthcoming WordPress 4.2 (tested up to beta 3)
* FIX: Fix regression in 1.9.60 for corner-case of S3 users with no permission to check their bucket's location (but permission to write to it).
* TWEAK: Make "settings saved" message disappear after a few seconds, to prevent UI clutter
* TWEAK: Decrease UI clutter in backup time selection
* TWEAK: Update to latest global SSL CA bundle, removing again 1024-bit root CAs (last attempted in 1.9.26, but S3 still had some legacy servers). Modern web browsers have not accepted these for 6 months now. (SSL verification can be turned off in the expert options).
* TWEAK: Defeat WP Download Manager Google Drive plugin's loading of its SDK on all pages (conflicting with UD when UD attempts to backup to Google Drive)
* TWEAK: Detect case of old MySQL on Windows with table prefix that varies by case (and hence WP actually only works by accident) - produce a consistent backup that can be restored on any MySQL server.
* TWEAK: Add dashboard notice with links to more resources, for free users who've been installed >4 weeks (with option to dismiss notice)
* TWEAK: Add itsec_log to the list of tables of non-essential/not-needing-search/replace + likely to be large tables for backup strategy

* TWEAK: Give timestamp of WPB2D backups without relying upon location of SQL file
* TWEAK: Detect a situation on migration where the uploads path is changed (from a site that began pre-WP 3.5) that was previously undetected
* TRANSLATIONS: French translation updated from less than half to complete, thanks to Erwan François. Various other translations updated (many thanks to all translators).

= 1.9.60 - 2015-02-24 =

* FEATURE: When using "Backup Now", and keeping the UpdraftPlus settings page open, a broken WP scheduler will not prevent the backup's progress.
* FEATURE: Amazon's "EU Central 1" Frankfurt region now supported again (Amazon began requiring their new signature method at this location - probably a sign of things to come everywhere). PHP 5.3.3 required for this region.
* FEATURE: Database backup files can now be handled when uncompressed - i.e., you can remove the gzip compression, and use the resulting file (useful for large backups on slow/limited hosting: pre-decompressing the file will reduce the processing time needed)
* FEATURE: Introduced new in-page auto-backup widget that can resume, and thus cope with a backup of any size. This feature is in preparation of WP 4.2's major re-write of the updating user experience flow.
* TWEAK: Update PHP-Opencloud (Rackspace) and dependency libraries to current versions.
* TWEAK: Make sure that activity is recorded periodically when adding database tables to the final database backup (found a site with over 7,500 tables)
* TWEAK: Don't bother to attempt to detect double-gz compression on setups where it can't be handled (where gzseek() has been disabled in the PHP configuration)
* TWEAK: Added free/Premium comparison table to the free version
* TWEAK: Importer (part of UpdraftPlus Premium) can now import generic .sql, .sql.gz and .sql.bz2 files
* TWEAK: Don't show the "memory limit" warning in a case where the value could not be accurately detected
* TWEAK: If the user chooses the "email" remote storage method, then a warning will be added if the archive being sent is bigger than most mailservers can carry (and will be removed if it is successfully sent), thus giving the user a hint as to the failure cause (if they overlooked the existing warning in the email settings).
* TWEAK: The importer (part of UpdraftPlus Premium) can now import the latest BackupWordPress format databases
* TWEAK: Flush output buffer explicitly when closing the browser connection - prevents delayed feedback on some setups
* TWEAK: Automatic backups are now offered if you go to the 'Plugins' page, and update via the 'More information' iframe
* TWEAK: Trim spaces from Google Drive client_id/secret - some users didn't spot that they introduced whitespace when copy-pasting
* TWEAK: Add "Simple Visitor Stats" and "Simple Feed Stats" tables to the list of tables that may have large amounts of data, and which don't need search/replacing when migrating
* TWEAK: When restoring plugins and themes, log the list of entities being restored (helps with tracing problems)
* TWEAK: Deal with CloudFTP/StorageMadeEasy returning directory listings in a non-standard format, when rescanning remote backups

* FIX: Fix issue when migrating (hence, in Premium versions only) backups with very large options tables output by mysqldump, which could cause the site URL to finish with an incorrect value

= 1.9.51 - 2015-02-03 =

* SECURITY: Prevent nonce leak that could allow logged-in users who aren't admins (if you have any) to access backups, UpdraftPlus settings and perform other harmful actions. No issue exists for users of UpdraftPlus Premium, or if you have the stand-alone "Automatic Backups" or "No Adverts" add-ons, or if your site has no untrusted users who can log in (or whilst have dismissed the "Automatic Backups" notice on the updates page). Credit to Sucuri (http://sucuri.net) for identifying this issue, and notifying us of it.

= 1.9.50 - 2015-01-29 =

* TWEAK: Importer now supports a previously-unseen format for WordPress Backup 2 Dropbox backups
* TWEAK: Fix cron calculation that could have prevented UpdraftPlus loading when using ALTERNATE_WP_CRON (see 1.9.45)

* TWEAK: Log more informative error if user chooses 'FTP' for their remote storage, but adds no FTP settings
* TWEAK: Change "any other directory" to "any other file/directory" in the "more files" add-on, to better reflect its capabilities

* TWEAK: Prevent 'Strict Standards' PHP coding notice with WebDAV on PHP 5.5
* TWEAK: Provide clickable link through to the admin email address in the reporting settings
* TWEAK: If the gzopen or gzread functions are disabled in the PHP install, then the message saying so omitted to say which one (or both)
* FIX: WebDAV upload method could very occasionally fail to detect upload error conditions

= 1.9.46 - 2014-12-29 =

* FEATURE: Chunked/resumable uploads are now supported for SFTP

* TWEAK: Prevent PHP notice when listing files on SFTP server
* TWEAK: Reset an internal upload counter used to detect activity when a cloud storage switch is made due to no apparent activity - could prevent some large, long-running uploads on hosts with little available execution time

* FIX: Fix case in which the database imported from a BackWPUp backup could be falsely identified as missing (introduced in 1.9.40)
* FIX: WordPress installs with ALTERNATE_WP_CRON set could skip some scheduled backups (since 1.9.19, so it appears that the conditions required to cause this bug are rare)

= 1.9.44 - 2014-12-13 =

* TRANSLATIONS: Add new incomplete translations (ready for the wordpress.org change to take translation availability into account when searching for plugins): Norwegian Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk, Finnish, Hebrew, Catalan, Vietnamese, Bengali

* FEATURE: Added encryption (used by default) to Amazon S3 communications
* FEATURE: New "more files" add-on, allowing backup of WordPress core and
non-WordPress files
* RELIABILITY: Various algorithm tweaks to help larger sites on lower
resources. Largest site a known user has: 1.5Gb
* RELIABILITY/FEATURE: Ship up-to-date SSL certificates, and added expert
options to prefer server SSL CA certificates, and to disable peer verification
* SPEED: Batch INSERT commands in database backups, for much faster
restoration (typically 95% faster)
* SPEED/RELIABILITY: FTP and FTPS (not SFTP) are now chunked and resumable
(both download and upload), subject to your FTP server responding correctly to
SIZE
* SPEED: Re-factoring of admin-area and some backup code into separate
lazy-loaded files, to reduce memory consumption on sites generally
* FIX: Clear PHP's file stat cache when checking for zip file activity - fixes
potential halt on very enormous sites or sites with very low PHP timeouts.
* FIX: Caught some untranslated strings
* FIX: Respect WordPress's WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT constant
* FIX: Remove timezone display from local time - WordPress's get_date_from_gmt
function does not completely do what the manual says it does
* FIX: A small typo slipped into 1.5.5 which prevented some Google Drive users
from setting up new installations
* FIX: Fix strict coding warnings on PHP 5.4
* TWEAK: In fix-time add-on, fade UI when relevant
* TWEAK: Improved UI of downloader
* TWEAK: Decrease FTP timeouts to improve our chances of getting back an error
before PHP aborts
* TWEAK: Tweaked al relevant methods to follow the general SSL CA certificate
options
