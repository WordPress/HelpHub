Adding custom roles designed for HelpHub project.

- Widgets (the front page is a widget container for flexibility, to avoid locking us in)
- Menus (The widget we've prepared for this purpose uses menus for ease of use even from a non-technical point of view)
- Posts (we use the default post/page capabilities for our own post type capability check)
